  "note": "Group 09 is for setting the shift change time, which is defaulted to midnight (00:00). If you clock in after 00:00, the entry will be recorded in the next day's column. However, if our latest off-duty time exceeds 00:00, we need to manually adjust the time for Group 09. For example, if you leave at 2:00 AM, you need to change Group 09 to at least 2:30 AM (to avoid clocking in exactly at 2:00 AM, which would push the entry to the next day). Typically, we set this time at least 30 minutes later than the latest off-duty time.",
